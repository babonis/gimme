Running Gimme
=============

Gimme should be able to run on any platform with Python interpreter.
You can simply run:

$ python gimme.py [input file].

Example: assemble transcripts from sample data

Gimme now support input file in PSL format (BLAT and GMAP support this format).

This version of Gimme fills up all small gaps in alignments.
The default gap is 21bp and is specified in MIN_INTRON in a source code.

You can also modify a length of minimal UTR by editing MIN_UTR value.
The default is 100 bp.
