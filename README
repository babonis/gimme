Prerequisite package
====================
Gimme requires Networkx package to manipulate a graph data structure.
You can download Networkx from http://networkx.lanl.gov/download.html.
Please make sure networkx is in your PYTHONPATH or standard Python libraries
on your computer.

Installation
============

No installation required.

Running Gimme
=============

Gimme should be able to run on any platform with Python interpreter.
You can simply run:

$ python gimme.py [input file].

Example: assemble transcripts from sample data

$ python ./src/gimme.py sample_data/sample.psl > sample.bed

Gimme now support input file in PSL format (BLAT and GMAP support this format).

Output
======

Output is written to standard output in BED format, which can be visualized
on UCSC genome browser or other browsers directly.
Gene models built by Gimme contain a maximum number of isoforms.
You can use a program in utils to find a minimum set of transcripts.
See Utilities for more detail.

Running Tests
=============

Run nosetests in the main directory to run all tests in tests directory.

Configuration
=============

This version of Gimme fills up all small gaps in alignments.
The default gap is 21bp and is specified in MIN_INTRON in a source code.

You can also modify a length of minimal UTR by editing MIN_UTR value.
The default is 100 bp.

Utilities
=========

Gimme contains many useful utilities that work with PSL, BED and SAM format.
Some programs are useful for building gene models. Others are useful for
working with reads, assembly sequences etc.

get_min_path.py
---------------

The program finds a minimal set of transcripts that contains all edges from
an exon graph.

Example:
$ python ./src/utils/get_min_path.py models.bed > models.min.bed
